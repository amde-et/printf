.SH Name
.B _printf
- prints formatted output of arguments

.SH Synopsis
#include "holberton.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH Description
The
.B _printf
function produces output according to a
.IB format
as described below.

.SS Return value
This function returns the total number of characters printed with the exception of the null byte (used to terminate strings).

.SS The flag characters
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
.RS
.SS
.I
#
The value should be converted to an alternate form
.RS
.SS
.I
0
The value should be padded with zeros rather than spaces.
.RS
.SS
.I
-
The converted value should be left aligned on the field boundary. The default is right alignment on the field boundary.
.RS
.SS
.I
" "
(a space) Signifies that a blank space be left before a positive number that is produced by a signed conversion
.RS
.SS
.I
+
A sign (+ or -) should always be placed before a number produced by a signed conversion, which by default was shown only for negative numbers.

.SS The field width
This is an optional decimal digit string (with nonzero first digit) that specifies the
minimum field width. The converted value is padded with spaces on the left (or right if the left-alignment flag has been given)
if the converted value has fewer characters than the field width. One may write * to
specify that the field width is given in the next argument, which must be an integer type. The field
width does not cause truncation of the converted value. The converted value must be printed
before any width adjustments are made.

.SS The precision
This is an optional precision value that is given as a period ('.') followed by an optional decimal digit string.
One may write '*' instead of a decimal digit to signify that the precision is given as an integer in the next argument.
The precision is taken to be zero if just '.' is provided. The precision specifies the minimum
number of digits to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
characters to be printed from a string for s conversions.

.SS The length modifier
In this context, we'll say integer conversion to mean conversion by one of the specifiers
.B d
,
.B i
,
.B o
,
.B u
,
.B x
, or
.B X
.RS
.SS
.I
h
Modifies the following integer to be a short signed or unsigned int
.RS
.SS
.I
l
Modifies the following integer to be a long signed or unsigned int

.SS The conversion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The supported conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.RS
.SS
.I
c
A conversion specifier that converts an int argument to a character and writes it.
.RS
.SS
.I
s
A conversion specifier that writes the characters of a const char * argument
up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\\0'). If a precision is specified,
no more than the specified number of characters are written and a null byte does not need to be present.
If the precision is not specified or is greater than the size of the array, a null byte must be present in the array.
.RS
.SS
.I
d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision,
if any, specifies the minimum number of digits that must appear; the converted value is paaded on the left with zeros if the value's length is less than the precision.
When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.RS
.SS
.I
o, u, x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned
hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions, whilst the upper case equivalent is used for X conversions. The precision,
if any, specifies the minimum number of digits that must appear; the converted value is paaded on the left with zeros if the value's length is less than the precision.
.RS
.SS
.I
%
A '%' is written and there is no conversion of any argument.
.RS
.SS
.I
p
A void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as if by
.SB %#x
).
.RS
.SS
.I
b
A custom conversion specifier that prints the binary representation of an unsigned int.
.RS
.SS
.I
R
A custom conversion specifier that prints the rot13 translation of a string.
.RS
.SS
.I
r
A custom conversion specifier that prints the reverse of a string.
.RS
.SS
.I
S
This is a custom conversion specifier that prints a string and the hexadecimal representation of non-printable characters in it starting with \\x (with the exception of the null byte).

.SH
Example
To print some weather details:
.PP
.nf
.RS
#include "holberton.h"
_printf("Wind: %d%s and Precipitation: %d%%\\n", 28, "km/h", 0x1a);
.RE
.fi
.EX
